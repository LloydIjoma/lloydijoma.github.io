Whatever you may think of new digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, 
block-chain and the Internet of Things, it cannot be ignored that they are changing the way we live and work.

Artificial intelligence and other digital systems do not only become more common, but they also become more accurate.

For instance, artificial intelligence already outperforms human lawyers in reviewing and annotating standardized contracts.
It’s happening all around us. Machines and intelligent systems are gradually taking over more and more routine tasks.


Consider the automotive industry. Collision warning, automatic braking, lane departure warning and blind spot notification systems are 
standard features on many of today’s cars.

And for the moment, these machines and systems are mainly designed to provide assistance for specific tasks in specific situations. 
They augment our intelligence and improve our skills.
